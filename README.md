## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

Some of the things I learnt include understanding and knowing how to use multiple media queries and determining when to use either flexbox or grid and which of them is most appropriate for a certain style.

```css
@media (max-width: 56em) {
    /* Code */
}
@media (max-width: 32em) {
    /* Code */
}
```
